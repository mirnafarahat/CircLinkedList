# Circular Linked List Implementation in Java

This project demonstrates the implementation of a circular linked list data structure in Java. Circular linked lists are similar to regular linked lists but have their tail node connected to the head node, forming a closed loop. This implementation provides basic operations such as insertion at the beginning, insertion at the end, insertion at a specific index, deletion from the beginning, and deletion from the end.

## Features

- Insert elements at the beginning, end, or a specific index in the circular linked list.
- Delete elements from the beginning or the end of the circular linked list.
- Efficient circular structure that allows continuous traversal.

## Usage

The provided `CircLinkedList` class includes methods to perform the described operations on the circular linked list. The `LinkedList` class in the repository's main package showcases the usage of these methods with sample data.
